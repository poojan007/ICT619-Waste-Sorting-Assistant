# SmartSort Waste Classification System

## Project Information

This project uses Machine Learning Model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) algorithms to determine if the waste is recycle or not. The model implements data augmentation and transfer learning with pre-trained VGG16 and MobileNet V2 models.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 22500 images of organic and recyclable objects. It comes from Kaggle and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/techsash/waste-classification-data)
